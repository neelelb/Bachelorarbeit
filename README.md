# Bachelorarbeit

A repo for preprocessing and analyzing experimental EMG and EDA Biopac Data in R used for my bachelor thesis in biological psychology. 

## Repo Content
The repo contains R files for 
* (1) importing the data, 
* (2) exploratory data analysis, 
* (3) plots for EDA, 
* (4) Analysis using Multivariate Multilevel Regression Model, and 
* (5) plots of the results


## Data
The data comes from a fear conditioning experiment conducted at the University of Potsdam. Participants were presented with geometrical stimuli on a computer screen. One of the geometrical stimuli was paired with an electrical stimulus on 50% of the trials, while the other one was never paired with such a stimulus. Startle-Eye-Blink responses (muscle activity, abbreviated STR) to the geometrical stimuli as well as skin conductance responses (electrodermal responses, abbreviated SCR) were acquired for each participant. 

## Analysis
The data was analysed using a multivariate multilevel regression model
